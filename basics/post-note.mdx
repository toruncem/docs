### After Your Note is Ready

Once your Scribe note has been generated and reviewed, you have several options for what to do next:

1. **Copy the Note**  
   Use the "Copy" button to copy the entire note to your clipboard. You can then paste it into your EHR or any other documentation system.

2. **Edit the Note**  
   If you notice any errors or want to make changes, you can edit the note directly before finalizing it.

3. **Provide Feedback**  
   Rate the quality of the note and provide feedback to help improve future Scribe notes.

4. **Transfer to EHR**  
   Follow the steps to transfer your note into your EHR system. See [Transfer Your Note to EHR](ehr_sync) for detailed instructions.

5. **Regenerate the Note**  
   If the note does not meet your expectations, you can use the "Regenerate" option to create a new version, optionally providing feedback to guide improvements.
