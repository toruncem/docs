## How to start a recording

After logging into [scribe.athelas.com](http://scribe.athelas.com), you will land on the Visits page by default. If you navigate away, you can always return via the ‘My Visits’ tab in the side navigation.

1. To start a new recording, navigate to ‘New Visit.’
2. Enter the patient’s name in the designated text box.
3. Select the appropriate template from the drop-down menu based on the type of visit.\
   Choose the visit type—either in-person or virtual.
   - For in-person visits, that means two external voices are being picked up by the recording device.
   - For virtual visits, one voice is external and one is from the device.
4. Once those selections are made, clikc "Start Recording".
