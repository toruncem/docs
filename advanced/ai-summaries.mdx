## AI Summaries

**AI Summaries** help you prepare for upcoming appointments by providing a concise summary of the patient's most recent visit. These summaries are generated automatically using AI and are available directly in the scribe creation flow for integrated users.

---

### What It Does

* Automatically pulls the patientâ€™s **last visit note**
* Summarizes key findings, symptoms, and treatment plans
* Displays the summary before starting a new scribe session
* Helps you **quickly get context** without reading full prior notes

> Example:
> *"On June 02, 2025, the patient experienced decreased pain in the first step and demonstrated improvement in left foot intrinsic strength..."*

---

### When and Where It Appears

* **Displayed during the scribe setup screen** for EMR-synced visits
* Visible beneath the patient name, template, and visit type selector
* Toggle between **Show/Hide** if you want to reference or minimize the summary

---

### Integration Required

AI Summaries are only available to sites with **EMR integration enabled**. The summary is based on structured or transcribed content from the patient's last documented visit.

---

### Benefits

* Quickly reorient before a follow-up visit
* Reduce time spent rereading long notes
* Improve continuity of care and patient personalization

> Use the summary as a baseline and confirm or update any findings during the current visit.
