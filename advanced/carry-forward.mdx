title: "Carry Forward Notes"
description: "Using previous notes, automatically incorperate them into your new note."

Here’s user-facing documentation for the **Carry Forward** feature in Athelas Scribe, written to clearly explain what it is, how it works (for both integrated and non-integrated workflows), and what users should expect:

---

## Carry Forward

**Carry Forward** helps providers save time by using relevant information from a patient’s previous visit note to pre-fill the new note for their current visit.

This feature is particularly useful for follow-ups or recurring visits, where much of the patient's history or previous assessments are still relevant.

---

### How It Works

When you select **Carry Forward** from the AI Actions menu:

* **Integrated Sites**:
  The new note is automatically created using content from the previous visit. You’ll be taken directly to the editing screen with carried-forward data already populated.

* **Non-Integrated Sites**:
  Selecting **Carry Forward** opens the new recording page with the previous note loaded as context. The system uses this to generate the new note once a new recording is completed.

### What Gets Carried Forward?

Each section in your note (e.g. Plan, Objective, Subjective) can behave differently depending on how the template is configured. Here's what may happen:

* `REGENERATE`: Section is freshly written based on new context (no carry forward).
* `CARRY_FORWARD_ONLY`: Section is copied exactly from the previous note (no new content).
* `CARRY_FORWARD_AND_APPEND`: Previous content is copied and new content is added at the end.
* `CARRY_FORWARD_AND_BLEND` (New!): Old and new content are merged together in a cohesive way.

> Your site admin or implementation specialist can configure how each section behaves.

---

### Smart Logic

Carry Forward uses an advanced language model (LLM) to intelligently decide what to include, how to merge past content, and when to regenerate a section completely. Behind the scenes, the system:

* Uses **guideline prompts** to guide behavior section by section
* Applies **system and user roles** in the AI call to ensure accurate, role-specific output
* Executes logic modularly to optimize performance and ensure consistent structure

---

### Benefits

* Saves time on repetitive documentation
* Ensures continuity between visits
* Reduces errors by keeping relevant context
* Works with both manual and EMR-integrated workflows
