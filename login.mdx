  <Accordion title="Preview changes" icon="rectangle-terminal">
    Previewing helps you make sure your changes look as intended. We built a
    command line interface to render these changes locally.

    1. Install the
       [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the
       documentation changes locally with this command: `npm i -g mintlify`
    2. Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where
       `docs.json` is): `mintlify dev`

    <Note>
      If youâ€™re currently using the legacy `mint.json` configuration file, please update the Mintlify CLI:

      `npm i -g mintlify@latest`
      And run the new upgrade command in your docs repository:

      `mintlify upgrade`
      You should now be using the new `docs.json` configuration file. Feel free to delete the `mint.json` file from your repository.
