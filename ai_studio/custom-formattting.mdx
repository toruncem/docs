### Custom Formatting

Customized Formatting can be a powerful tool to turn a good note, into your note. With this feature, you can instruct the AI to create notes tailored to your style and requirements. Simply use an English command to tell the AI what you want it to do.


### Formatting Examples

- When documenting pain levels, write it as a number out of 10 in numerals
- Create a numbered problem list based on subjective and objective
- After the Assessment section, add a section called Assessment/Objective to include
a one paragraph summary combining the Assessment and Objective sections and
justifying the need for continued PT (unless the patient is to be dischargedÂ­)
- Create a list of patient goals and/or progress towards goals based on subjective and
objective
- Create a comma-separated list of all neuromuscular re-education performed under
the heading Neuromuscular Re-education
- Create a comma-separated list of all therapeutic activities performed under the
heading Therapeutic Activities
- Create a comma-separated list of muscles released through dry needling and/or dry
needling protocols used; include, if used, the amount of time electrical stimulation
with needling was done (under the heading Dry Needling)
- Create the Assessment as a narrative of what the PT did that day and how the patient
responded
- Never write the subjective, objective, assessment, or plan in a numbered list
- Always document general exam
- If I am talking to the scribe before the start of a visit this is all considered important
information and should be included in the documentation.


*Style* 

- Refer to the patient by their name instead of patient
- Never write a note in the first person
- Always abbreviate physical therapy as PT
- The provider addressing the patient is always the physical therapist
- Refer to the PT as Therapist
