*Dot Phrases*

- When I say “ears look good” replace with “Right canal is clear, Tympanic membrane is
grey with normal light reflex, Left canal is clear, Tympanic membrane is grey with
normal light reflex. no effusions”
- When I say “mouth looks good” replace with “mucous membranes are moist, teeth in
good repair, posterior pharynx is without erythema, without exudate”
- When I say “heart is good” replace with “heart is regular, no murmurs, rate is normal”
- When I say “lungs sound good” replace “lungs with good airflow, no wheeze
start recognizing key phrases to note that the area was examined and not document
”not examined”
- “I’m going to listen to your neck” or “swallow for me” = neck exam
- “just breath normal for me” = heart exam
- “big deep breath” = lung exam
- “lay back here I’m going to feel your belly” = abdominal exam, ect
- “any fluid in your legs” = extremities
- Instead of saying “no information provided” just leave the entire section blank, leave it
out. For example in the physical exam instead of saying “abdomen - no information or
not examined” just delete the abdomen portion of the exam.
- If I ask the patient particular medical questions include the patient s answers in the
history. For example “are you checking your sugars at home”, “are you checking your
blood pressure at home”, “how long has the symptom been present”, “are there other
associated symptoms”. If I ask the patient a series of questions related to a certain
concern or complaint all their answers should be documented.
