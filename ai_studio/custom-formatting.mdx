## Custom Formatting

**Custom Formatting** allows providers to personalize how their notes are generated. By setting specific formatting instructions, you can ensure the output consistently reflects your clinical style, preferences, and workflow needs.

### What It Does

Custom formatting applies note-by-note instructions to the AI, as if you were guiding a human scribe. These rules impact how the note is structured, phrased, and presented.

For example, you can instruct the system to:

* Bold all section headers
* Use bullet points in the plan
* Include gender-based salutations (e.g., “Mr” or “Mrs”)
* Number the patient’s next steps
* Add specific formatting for medications or vitals

> The model will follow these instructions every time it generates a note for the selected template.

### How to Set It Up

1. Navigate to **Custom Formatting** under the AI Studio.
2. Select the note template (e.g., SOAP Note, Progress Note).
3. Use the prompt box to type your rules (up to 4,000 characters).
4. Click **Save Rules**.

You can also click **"See more example rules"** for inspiration.

### Notes

* Formatting rules only apply to future scribe generations.
* To apply updated rules to a past note, you must **regenerate** that note.
* Each template can have its own formatting rules—great for specialists or multi-format teams.

### Examples of Useful Rules

```
- Use bullet points for all sections except Subjective.
- End each note with “Follow-up as needed.”
- Avoid abbreviations for diagnoses.
- Always refer to the patient as “the patient” (not “Pt.”).
```


### Formatting Examples

- When documenting pain levels, write it as a number out of 10 in numerals
- Create a numbered problem list based on subjective and objective
- After the Assessment section, add a section called Assessment/Objective to include
a one paragraph summary combining the Assessment and Objective sections and
justifying the need for continued PT (unless the patient is to be discharged­)
- Create a list of patient goals and/or progress towards goals based on subjective and
objective
- Create a comma-separated list of all neuromuscular re-education performed under
the heading Neuromuscular Re-education
- Create a comma-separated list of all therapeutic activities performed under the
heading Therapeutic Activities
- Create a comma-separated list of muscles released through dry needling and/or dry
needling protocols used; include, if used, the amount of time electrical stimulation
with needling was done (under the heading Dry Needling)
- Create the Assessment as a narrative of what the PT did that day and how the patient
responded
- Never write the subjective, objective, assessment, or plan in a numbered list
- Always document general exam
- If I am talking to the scribe before the start of a visit this is all considered important
information and should be included in the documentation.


*Style* 

- Refer to the patient by their name instead of patient
- Never write a note in the first person
- Always abbreviate physical therapy as PT
- The provider addressing the patient is always the physical therapist
- Refer to the PT as Therapist
